# Rancher 2.x stand-up scripts for GKE

This repository contains my preferred method of standing-up
a GKE Kubernetes cluster, with Rancher 2.x as an orchestration
layer, and a cluster-wide Traefik ingress behind a GCP Layer 4
load balancer.

This may not represent the best practice for your organization
or business requirements and no warranty is made regarding
suitability. Use at your own risk and with due diligence as to
the contents of the configuration included.

# Overview

The goal is to install Rancher 2.x on a GKE cluster, configure
Traefik to handle all the cluster's HTTP/HTTPS termination
(including for Rancher itself) and take advantage of GKE's hosted
K8s master while Rancher stores its configuration in the cluster's
etcd store.

## Deploy steps

1. Create a GKE cluster in the GCP web console or CLI. If you
    wish to employ network policies on Calico, GKE's network
    driver, select the Network Policy option in the advanced
    settings for the cluster. It is not enabled by default.
1. Download and install the GCP `gcloud` utility and `kubectl`,
    if you don't already have them.
1. Fetch credentials for your cluster:
    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials NAME [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG â€¦]
    ```
1. Deploy the required cluster role bindings in `cluster-admin.yml`.
    This will require your GCP account to either have container
    service admin permissions, OR use admin credentials.
    As such:
    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters describe <cluster name> --zone <zone> | grep password
    kubectl config set-credentials <credentialname> --username=admin --password=<password from above>
    kubectl config set-context <context name> --user=<credentialname> --cluster=<full GKE cluster name>
    kubectl --context=<context name> apply -f k8s/cluster-admin.yml
    ```
   Where `<full GKE cluster name>` is the name key of the cluster
   entry in your `~/.kube/config` file, in the rough format of
   `gke_PROJECTNAME_ZONE|REGION_CLUSTERNAME`.
1. Create the etcd operator (supervisor) and some basic cluster
    configuration: `kubectl apply -f k8s/cluster.yml`.
1. Create the [etcd cluster](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kv-config/)
    for Traefik: `kubectl apply -f k8s/etcd.yml`.
    You may want to consider an etcd cluster backup or persistence
    strategy, which is out of scope, here.
1. Store the traefik config (replacing your hostmaster address
    for the default in the ACME config):
    `kubectl apply -f k8s/storeconfig.yml`.
1. Retrieve the L4 load balancer IP: `kubectl -n cluster-services get service`.
    It will be listed as the `EXTERNAL-IP`. Optionally reserve it
    as a static IP in your VPC network configuration in the cloud
    console.
1. Set a DNS record for rancher, on the load balancer IP. Place
    this hostname for `CATTLE_SERVER_URL` in `k8s/cattle.yml`,
    as well as in the ingress config in `k8s/traefik-controller.yml`.
1. Start Traefik: `kubectl apply -f k8s/traefik-controller.yml`.
1. Start Rancher: `kubectl apply -f k8s/cattle.yml`.
1. Log in to Rancher (which should now have a Let's Encrypt TLS
    certificate) and set your admin password.
1. Validate in the Google Cloud console that all your workloads
    (including system objects) are in an OK status.
1. If you are wishing to use Rancher's network policy features,
    there is [a ticket](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14085)
    relating to Rancher's support for Calico in Rancher >= 2.0.8.
    Prior to this version, it was possible to trick Rancher into
    creating project-scoped network policy rules on Calico, but
    [this was changed](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.0.8)
    and at the moment, network policies are only supported on RKE-
    created clusters, and if you opt in.
1. If you wish to use Google's cloud SQL with a proxy container,
    consult `k8s/mysql.yml` and [this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-kubernetes-engine).
    You will need to create a JSON snippet of credentials and store
    them in a secret.
